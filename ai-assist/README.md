# ai-assist — listen & draft meeting notes

A self-contained desktop assistant (Java 21 / Spring Boot) that **listens** to
a meeting happening on this computer — MS Teams, Webex, or any platform, plus
the room via the microphone — transcribes the **English** speech locally, and
when you press **Stop** drafts the complete meeting notes and saves them as a
timestamped file.

**No internet. No browser. No other apps. No third-party drivers.** The app
uses only the operating system's own resources (audio devices, a window,
files). Speech recognition runs inside the app with the proven, lightweight
[Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/) English models you place in the app
folder — on first start any model `.zip` you dropped there is extracted
(a progress bar shows) and offered in the dropdown.

## 100 % open source

Every component in and around this app is open source; there are no
proprietary libraries, models, or cloud services anywhere:

| Component | License |
|---|---|
| ai-assist code and its native helper sources | this repository |
| Spring Boot, Jackson, Apache Commons Lang | Apache-2.0 |
| Vosk speech engine (live captions) | Apache-2.0 |
| Whisper / whisper.cpp + whisper-jni (final transcript) | MIT |
| JNA (native access) | Apache-2.0 / LGPL-2.1 dual |
| Java runtime (use e.g. Eclipse Temurin) | GPLv2 + Classpath Exception |
| BlackHole (optional macOS fallback) | GPL-3.0 |
| Ollama + models (optional drafting) | MIT / open-weight |

The only closed-source code involved is the operating system itself
(Windows/macOS APIs and their bundled compilers), which no application can
avoid.

## The window

Launching the app opens its own window (built on Swing, which ships with the
JDK — not a browser):

- an editable **meeting title** at the top — it becomes the notes file name;
  when a meeting app (Teams, Webex, Zoom, Slack) is detected running, the
  title is pre-filled and the status line notes the detection,
- a **model dropdown** (top-right): the built-in small English model by
  default, plus any Vosk model you unzip into a `models/` folder next to the
  jar; the model you pick is remembered as your default across launches — switching mid-meeting pauses briefly and resumes with the new model.
  Recommended for noisy rooms (from
  [alphacephei.com/vosk/models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)):
  `vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph` (128 MB, compact and notably more accurate)
  or `vosk-model-en-us-0.22` (1.8 GB, most accurate),
- a **Dark** toggle (top-right) switching the whole window between light and
  dark mode; the choice is remembered across launches,
- a **scrolling text box** where the running transcript appears live, each
  line time-stamped and tagged `[you]` (your microphone) or `[other]` (the system audio),
- a **live caption line** showing words as they are being recognized,
  before the phrase is final — like the captions in commercial apps,
- **Start / Pause / Stop** buttons show their label in **green** when that
  action applies right now and **red** when it does not: at launch only
  Start is green (listening does NOT begin automatically); while listening,
  Pause and Stop are green; while paused, Resume (Start) and Stop are green
  and Pause is red,
- **Start** — begins the meeting, or resumes it after a Pause,
- **Pause** — temporarily stop listening without ending the meeting,
- **Apply** — summarize the meeting *so far* without ending it: a detailed
  summary with action points is drafted from everything captured up to this
  point and shown in a **Summary** pane below the live transcript (drag the
  divider to resize). This is the *same* summary the **Meeting summary**
  checkbox produces on the Editor and Compose tabs — Apply behaves identically
  on every tab, using the local Ollama LLM when enabled and the built-in
  drafter otherwise. Press it as often as you like; the running transcript
  keeps flowing above it. Nothing is saved — this is a live preview,
- **Stop** — the meeting is complete: capture stops, the **summary** (meeting
  notes) followed by the **full verbatim transcript** is saved as a
  timestamped rich-text (.rtf) file on your **Desktop**
  (e.g. `2026-07-05_15-02-41_live-meeting-notes.rtf`), and that same summary
  is shown in the Summary pane,
- **who said what**: every transcript line is tagged with its source —
  `[you]` is you / your side of the room, `[other]` is the other
  participants captured from the system audio. The tags appear live in the
  window, in the running interim draft, and in a "Full transcript (who said
  what)" section at the end of the saved notes,
- the **close button in the top corner** — if a meeting is still running you
  are asked whether to save before closing.

### Editor tab

A second tab next to the meeting view: paste any text, or press **Load** to
pick a file with the native file dialog (Finder on macOS, Explorer on
Windows), then apply an offline transformation — all deterministic and
identical on both platforms:

Tick any combination of **Fix grammar**, **Make compact**, **Make detailed**,
**Professional**, **Bullet points**, and any of the 13 communication-style
checkboxes, optionally type free-form **Instructions** (these need the
optional local Ollama), and press **Apply** — every checked option and the
instructions are applied together and the corrected content replaces the text (document view with vertical and
horizontal scroll bars). **Download** saves the result to your **Desktop**
with the same file name and format (a "-edited" suffix is added if the name
is taken).

Tick **Meeting summary** to turn the text into a **detailed summary with
action points** instead: press **Apply** and the content (a transcript,
pasted notes, anything) is rewritten as meeting notes — an overview, key
points, and an **Action items** list. With the optional local Ollama enabled
the summary is written by the LLM (and honours your **Instructions**);
without it, the built-in drafter produces the structured notes offline. When
**Meeting summary** is checked it takes over the Apply button, so the other
editing options are skipped for that run.

While a meeting is running, the Editor and
Compose tabs hide the meeting controls and show a blinking
**● MEETING IN PROGRESS** banner instead; switching back to the Meeting tab
restores the title row, status, and buttons.

### Compose tab

Type or paste into the **top** box (*Your content*), tick any combination
of the 13 style checkboxes — Formal, Concise, Consultative, Diplomatic,
Commanding, Persuasive, Empathetic, Transparent, Conversational, Casual,
Direct, Analytical, Assertive — optionally add **Instructions**, and press
**Apply**: the grammar-corrected result appears in the bottom **Modified**
box (drag the divider to resize). Drafting is deterministic and offline: each style combines
contraction handling, hedging, formal/casual word choice, framing lines,
and structure. For free-form LLM-quality rewriting, enable the optional
local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) integration (`ai-assist.ollama.enabled=true`)
— style drafts then go through your local model, falling back to the
rules automatically.

Tick **Meeting summary** (next to Instructions) and Apply turns your content
into a **detailed summary with action points** — the same overview / key
points / **Action items** notes as the Editor tab, written by the local LLM
when Ollama is enabled, or by the built-in drafter offline.

### How a meeting is processed — two engines, both offline

- **Live captions (Vosk):** while you talk, the meeting box shows real-time
  speech-to-text, verbatim, no AI. The audio is recorded locally at the same
  time (temp files, one per source).
- **Complete transcript (Whisper):** on **Stop**, the whole recorded meeting
  is transcribed with **OpenAI Whisper** (whisper.cpp, MIT) for an accurate,
  complete-conversation transcript, ordered across sources; the recording is
  then deleted. If no Whisper model is present, the notes fall back to the
  live captions.
- **No AI while the meeting is in progress** — the live box shows only the
  raw verbatim captions. AI drafting happens only when you ask for it: press
  **Apply** on the Meeting tab for a live summary, or **Stop** to save the
  summary together with the full verbatim transcript. Grammar and style
  rewriting stay on the Editor and Compose tabs.

Whisper runs 100% locally on the CPU; its native libraries are bundled in
the jar. It needs one `ggml-*.bin` model file, which is **not** committed to
this repo — the models are 142 MB – 1.5 GB, over GitHub's 100 MB per-file
limit. Fetch one with the scripts in the [`models/`](models/) folder (no
Hugging Face account needed; they pull from a public GitHub mirror):

```bash
cd models
./download-models.sh        # fast + accurate (base + small)   — Windows: download-models.bat
./download-models.sh all    # also fetch medium (1.5 GB, most accurate)
```

Keep the `models/` folder next to `ai-assist-<version>.jar` and the app finds
the model automatically on Stop. See [`models/README.md`](models/README.md)
for the model comparison, checksums/trust notes, and the official Hugging Face
source.

Nothing is written to disk until Stop (or a confirmed save-on-close).

## What it hears

The app captures **two streams at once**, each transcribed independently:
**the microphone** (you and the room, tagged `[you]`) and **the meeting
audio** (the other participants, tagged `[other]`).

### How the meeting audio is captured — same technique as the commercial apps

Commercial meeting-notes tools get system audio one of three ways: a cloud
bot that joins the call (Otter/Fireflies), a bundled virtual audio driver,
or — the modern way — the OS's own audio-capture API. **ai-assist uses the
OS API**, via a tiny helper it builds once on your machine from source
shipped inside the jar, using compilers the OS already has:

| OS | Mechanism | One-time requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows (Vista…11)** | **WASAPI loopback** on the default output — captures whatever the PC plays, works with any headphones, no Stereo Mix needed | none: a prebuilt helper ships inside the jar, built from the proven open-source [`wasapi`](https://crates.io/crates/wasapi) Rust crate (MIT; source in `native/windows-tap`) |
| **macOS 14.2+** | **Core Audio system-audio tap** — Apple's API for exactly this (what Granola-style apps use) | Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`; already present if you use Homebrew), and approving the one-time **"System Audio Recording"** permission prompt |

When the app starts (or when you press Pause → Resume), it prepares the
helper and lists **`system audio (native tap) [other]`** in the status
line, with its own live level. If the helper can't be built on your machine,
the app falls back automatically to the routes below.

### Fallback 1 — loopback capture devices

Any OS capture device that carries what the computer is playing:
   - **Windows 11**: many built-in sound drivers expose **Stereo Mix** — it's
     already installed, just enable it: *Settings → System → Sound → More
     sound settings → Recording → right-click → Show Disabled Devices →
     enable "Stereo Mix"*. The app auto-detects and uses it.
   - **macOS**: no built-in loopback exists; the open-source
     **BlackHole** driver (section below) provides one.

### Fallback 2 — meeting audio through the speakers

Works on every OS with nothing to install, enable, or configure: let the
meeting play out loud and the microphone hears both you **and** the remote
participants. Set it up like this:

1. **Unplug/disconnect headphones** — if the meeting plays into your ears,
   the microphone can't hear it. AirPods or a headset must be disconnected
   (or at least not selected as the meeting's speaker).
2. **Point the meeting app at the speakers**:
   - *MS Teams*: Settings → Devices → **Speaker** → choose the built-in
     speakers (e.g. "MacBook Pro Speakers").
   - *Webex*: Settings → Audio → **Speaker** → choose the built-in speakers.
   - Or simply set the system default output to the speakers (macOS:
     System Settings → Sound → Output; Windows: Settings → System → Sound).
3. **Raise the volume** to a normal conversational level (roughly 50 % or
   more) — if you can hear the meeting comfortably, so can the microphone.
4. **Leave the microphone unobstructed** (don't cover the laptop keyboard
   area with papers or a phone).
5. **macOS: set Mic Mode to "Standard"** — open Control Center (menu bar)
   while the app is listening, click **Mic Mode**, choose **Standard**.
   *Voice Isolation* actively removes everything that isn't your own voice —
   including the meeting audio — and is the most common reason remote
   participants don't get transcribed.
6. Check the ai-assist window: the status line shows a live **audio level**
   per source. Play any video with speech — the level should jump and the
   words should appear in the transcript within a couple of seconds. In this
   route everything arrives through the microphone, so lines are tagged
   `[you]` — that's expected. If the level stays near 0 % while audio is
   playing, the window tells you and points at the usual causes.

Notes: meeting apps cancel their own echo, so the remote side will not hear
themselves back; transcription quality is best in a quiet room.

### Best option on macOS: BlackHole (open source, one-time install)

If you're allowed to install open-source software, this is the clean answer
for macOS — it captures the meeting directly, silently, and works with
headphones. [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) is a
free, GPL-3.0 virtual audio driver:

1. **Install** it: `brew install blackhole-2ch`, or download the installer
   from the [BlackHole GitHub page](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole)
   (choose the 2ch variant).
2. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications → Utilities) → **+** →
   **Create Multi-Output Device** → tick **your headphones (or speakers)**
   and **BlackHole 2ch**.
3. Select that **Multi-Output Device** as the speaker in Teams/Webex (or as
   the system output). You hear the meeting normally; BlackHole carries a
   copy of it.
4. Restart ai-assist. It **auto-detects BlackHole** as the meeting source —
   the status line lists it and remote speech appears tagged `[meeting]`,
   while your own voice still arrives via the microphone as `[you]`.

### If you must use headphones (without installing anything)

The zero-setup route needs the meeting to be audible in the room. With
headphones, your options without installing anything are:

- **Windows, headphones in the analog jack**: enable **Stereo Mix** (see
  above). It captures the output mix of the built-in sound card, so it keeps
  working with jack-connected headphones. (Bluetooth/USB headsets bypass the
  sound card, so Stereo Mix won't carry them.)
- **macOS: Multi-Output Device** (built-in, no install): open
  **Audio MIDI Setup** (Applications → Utilities), click **+** →
  **Create Multi-Output Device**, tick both your headphones and
  **Built-in Speakers** — then select that Multi-Output Device as the
  meeting's speaker. You hear the meeting in your headphones while the
  built-in speakers also play it for the microphone; keep the speaker
  volume low — the mic sits right next to them. Caveat: the meeting is
  quietly audible in the room, so this isn't for confidential calls in
  shared spaces.
- **Fully silent capture with headphones on macOS needs BlackHole** (the
  open-source driver above) — the OS itself offers no app-accessible
  loopback today. macOS 14.2+ has a native "audio process tap" API that
  could remove even that install in a future version of ai-assist.

## Getting the app

**Ready-built**: `dist/ai-assist-<version>.jar` in this repository is the
app (no model bundled). Put it in a folder, then download one or more Vosk
English models from [alphacephei.com/vosk/models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models)
and drop the `.zip` files into the **same folder**. On first start each zip
is extracted (a progress bar shows) and appears in the model dropdown.
Recommended: `vosk-model-en-us-0.22-lgraph` (128 MB) or, for the smallest,
`vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` (40 MB).

To rebuild the app: `mvn package`. To also fetch the small model into
`./models` at build time: `mvn package -Pfetch-model`.

To refresh the model archive from upstream, build with `-Pfetch-model`.

The result, `target/ai-assist-<version>.jar`, is **one file containing
everything** — code and speech model. That single jar is all you ever copy,
ship, or click: **double-click it** to start (needs Java 21+, e.g. from
[adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net)), or run `java -jar ai-assist-<version>.jar`.
The embedded model is unpacked invisibly into OS temp space at startup; the
only visible output the app ever creates is the notes file that appears on
your Desktop when you press Stop — never anything in the folder it was
launched from. The app makes **zero network requests at runtime** — verified
by socket inspection in testing.

> Recording a meeting may require participants' consent depending on your
> jurisdiction and company policy.

## Running on macOS — complete setup

Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs (the speech engine ships as a
universal binary; no Rosetta needed).

1. **Install Java 21+** if not present: download the `.pkg` from
   [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net) and install. Verify with
   `java -version` in Terminal.
2. **Start the app**: `java -jar /Applications/ai-assist-<version>.jar`
   (from Terminal), or double-click the jar if your Java installation
   registered the `.jar` file association. The jar can live anywhere —
   `/Applications`, `~/Downloads`, a USB stick — it never writes next to
   itself.
3. **Approve microphone access** the first time: macOS shows a permission
   prompt attributed to whatever launched Java — *Terminal* if you started
   from a terminal, *Java* if you double-clicked. Click **Allow**. The app's
   status line tells you while it is waiting on this.
4. The window opens, listening starts automatically, and after the meeting
   you press **Stop**: the notes file appears on your
   Desktop.

### macOS troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause & fix |
|---|---|
| Status stuck on *"Opening audio devices…"* | macOS is waiting for microphone approval. Look for the permission prompt (it can hide behind windows). If it never appears: System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Microphone** → enable **Terminal** (or **Java**), then restart the app. To force a fresh prompt: `tccutil reset Microphone` in Terminal. |
| `Audio problem: UnsatisfiedLinkError … vosk_recognizer_set_grm` | You are running a build older than 2026-07-06. The vosk-java wrapper eagerly binds symbols its own macOS library doesn't export; current builds bypass it with a lazy binding. `git pull && mvn package` and use the new jar. |
| `Audio problem: … accepted none of the candidate formats` | The capture device refused every format (16/48/44.1 kHz, mono/stereo). Usually means microphone permission is denied (see above) or the selected input device is unavailable — check System Settings → Sound → **Input**. |
| "ai-assist-…jar cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" | Gatekeeper quarantines browser-downloaded files. Right-click the jar → **Open**, or clear the flag: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ai-assist-<version>.jar`. Jars pulled via `git` are not quarantined. |
| Double-click does nothing / opens Archive Utility | Your Java install didn't claim the `.jar` association. Right-click → Open With → select the Java launcher, or just run `java -jar ai-assist-<version>.jar` from Terminal. |
| *"Preparing speech model…"* for more than ~30 s | First run unpacks + loads the model (5–20 s is normal). Longer means a hidden failure — current builds surface it in red in the status line; run from Terminal to also see the full log. |
| Remote participants aren't transcribed (only your own speech appears) | macOS has no built-in loopback device, so the meeting must be audible: follow the **Zero-setup route** above (speakers, not headphones). Then check, in this order: ① Control Center → **Mic Mode** must be **Standard** — *Voice Isolation strips the meeting audio out of the mic signal*; ② speaker volume ≥ 50 %; ③ watch the **audio level** in the app's status line while a video with speech plays — it should jump well above 0 %. With headphones, see **If you must use headphones** above. |
| Status line never shows `system audio (native tap)` | macOS: the helper couldn't be built — install the Command Line Tools once (`xcode-select --install`), then press Pause → Resume. Windows: the helper is prebuilt inside the jar, so check the log (run from a terminal) for the `Native system-audio tap unavailable:` line, which states the exact reason. If the tap fails while running, the app disables it and Pause → Resume switches to the fallback capture automatically. |
| Native tap listed but `[meeting]` level stays 0 % / helper exits (macOS) | The "System Audio Recording" permission was denied or never shown. System Settings → Privacy & Security → **Screen & System Audio Recording** → **System Audio Recording Only** tab → enable Terminal (or Java), then press Pause → Resume. The `[system-tap]` log lines show the exact error. |
| BlackHole installed but missing from Audio MIDI Setup / Multi-Output list | CoreAudio only loads new drivers when it restarts. ① Verify the install: `ls /Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL/` must show `BlackHole2ch.driver` — if not, the installer didn't finish (it asks for an admin password); `brew reinstall blackhole-2ch` or rerun the `.pkg`. ② Restart the audio daemon: `sudo killall coreaudiod` (it relaunches itself) — or reboot. ③ Fully quit Audio MIDI Setup (⌘Q) and reopen; **BlackHole 2ch** now appears in the device list and the Multi-Output tick-list. |
| Where are my notes / the model? | Notes: on the **Desktop**, named `<date>_<time>_live-meeting-notes.rtf`. Model cache: `$TMPDIR/ai-assist/models` (managed by the OS; safe to ignore). |

## How it works

```
Teams/Webex audio (OS loopback device) ─► Vosk recognizer ─┐
Microphone ────────────────────────────► Vosk recognizer ─┼─► listening session ─► drafting engine ─► window + timestamped .md on Stop
                                                           │      (transcript)       (summary, sections,
                                          [mic]/[meeting] ─┘                          key points, action items)
```

- Every recognized phrase lands in one **listening session**, labelled with
  its source and sequence. No AI runs while the meeting is in progress.
- **Apply** (Meeting tab) drafts a summary of everything captured so far and
  shows it in memory — never on disk.
- **Stop** locks the session, drafts the summary — title, summary,
  discussion, key points, action items — appends the full verbatim
  transcript, and saves the one final timestamped file.

## Optional REST API (localhost)

The window drives everything, but the same controls exist as a local API:
sessions (`/api/sessions…`), capture (`/api/live/start|pause|resume|stop|status`),
meeting end (`/api/live/end`, `/api/sessions/{id}/end` — the only calls that
write the notes file), previews (`/api/draft`, `/api/sessions/{id}/draft`),
and device listing (`/api/audio/devices`).

## Configuration (`application.yml`)

```yaml
ai-assist:
  output:
    save-drafts: true          # save final notes at meeting Stop
    dir: ${user.home}/Desktop   # where the notes file appears on Stop
  auto:
    start-capture: true        # listen immediately on launch
    draft-interval-seconds: 30 # interim in-memory draft cadence
    content-type: MEETING_NOTES
    tone: PROFESSIONAL
  transcription:
    model-name: vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15  # English; embedded in the jar
    allow-download: false      # keep false: no runtime network access
    preferred-device: ""       # optional explicit meeting-audio device
```

## Platforms

| Platform | Support |
|---|---|
| Windows 11 | Full — mic always; meeting audio via built-in Stereo Mix (when the driver provides it) or the speakers route |
| macOS | Full — mic always; meeting audio via open-source [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) (recommended, auto-detected) or the speakers route (macOS has no built-in loopback device) |
| Linux | Full — mic always; meeting audio via the PulseAudio/PipeWire Monitor source (built into the OS) |
